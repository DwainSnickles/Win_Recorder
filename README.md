# Win_Recorder
Windows forms version using ScreenRecordLib
Using Screen Recorder Library there wasn't a good enough Win forms app.
This source code extends that with the following:
1) Allow custom sizes using form as area to record area.
2) Allows Full screen recording.
3) Auto minimize and restore forms using hotkey M when recording full screen.
4) Add hotkey M to stop recording and resets the form and toolbar.
5) Auto saves video when recording is stopped.
6) Allows independant Mic and speakers or both.
7) Add Hotkey P to allow pause while in fullscreen mode.
8) Allows end user to include their PC Cam in video.
9) Seperate form for camera while in fullscreen mode.

Both camera controls can be moved and resisized as desired.
Recent Videos gets updated automatically to prevent file not found when files are deleted.
Fixed a few bugs found while troubleshooting.

ToDo: Need to figure out how to upload files to Youtube and possibly other online sites.
