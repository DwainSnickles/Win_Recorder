# Win_Recorder
Windows forms version using ScreenRecordLib
Original Library (Not Modified at all)
https://github.com/sskodje/ScreenRecorderLib
Using Screen Recorder Library there wasn't a good enough Win forms app.
This source code extends that with the following:
1) Allow custom sizes using form as area to record area.
2) Allows Full screen recording.
3) Auto minimize and restore forms using hotkey M when recording full screen.
4) Add hotkey M to stop recording and resets the form and toolbar.
5) Auto saves video when recording is stopped.
6) Allows independant Mic and speakers or both.

Next Update will allow adding the camera in a small picturebox to author can be shown if desired.

Note Only the area inside the blue rectangle is recorded in Custom Mode.
